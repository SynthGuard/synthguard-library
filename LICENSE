This Licence is a non-exclusive licence, under which the Licensor grants
the Licensee a non-exclusive right to use the licensed work referred to
in section [Licensed work](#licensed-work) in accordance with the terms set out in this
License.

The term "**Licensee**" refers to any natural or legal person who
obtains, accesses, downloads, installs, uses, copies, modifies, or
distributes the licensed work defined in section
[Licensed work](#licensed-work) under the terms of this Licence. By exercising any rights granted

Licence.

Licence.

The commencement of use of the licensed work, as referred to in section

## Licensed work

This License applies to the software of the **SynthGuard^TM^ Prototype**
and documentation collectively referred to as the "**SGP**", which
includes all source code, binaries, configuration files, and
documentation contained in the project repository or distributed as part
of the package titled: **SynthGuard^TM^ Prototype**.\
Version: **0.1**\
Date: **16.05.2025**

This License applies solely to the original components of
**SynthGuard^TM^ Prototype** and does not apply to the third-party code
included therein (see section
[Third-party code and license](#third-party-code-and-license)), which remains subject to its own
separate license terms.

## Third-party code and license

The SGP incorporates code derived from the Synthetic Data Vault
(hereinafter "**SDV**") project, which is distributed under the terms of
the Business Source License 1.1 (BUSL-1.1). The SDV source code and
license terms can be found at:
<https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/blob/main/LICENSE.>

The SDV component is used as a dependency in the synthetic data
generation operations of SynthGuard^TM^ Prototype. From SDV open source
API, the SGP uses features such as metadata extraction, synthetic data
generation and certain evaluation mechanisms (please see the SDV
Community version: <https://pypi.org/project/sdv/>).

If the SDV component is used, distributed, or otherwise relied upon
separately or as part of derivative works, compliance with all
applicable terms of the Business Source License 1.1, as set forth in the
SDV repository, is required.

Nothing in this Custom Non-Commercial License grants rights to use the
SDV code beyond those use cases explicitly provided by its original
license.
